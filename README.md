AirBnB Clone Command Interpreter
Project Description
This project is the first step towards building an AirBnB clone, involving the creation of a command interpreter to manage AirBnB objects. The command interpreter allows users to interact with the system, create and retrieve objects, perform operations, update attributes, and more.

Command Interpreter Overview
The command interpreter is designed to handle the following tasks:

Create Objects:

Users can create new objects, such as a new User or a new Place.
Retrieve Objects:

Retrieve objects from a file, database, or other sources.
Object Operations:

Perform various operations on objects, such as counting and computing stats.
Update Object Attributes:

Update attributes of an existing object.
Destroy Objects:

Delete or destroy an object.
How to Start the Command Interpreter
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/airbnb-clone.git
